# Networking

####What is a network
A network is 2 or more computers connected to each other.  The purpose of this connection varies, but can include: uses each other's resources (printer, scanner, etc.), to game with each other, etc.

####Types of networks

We can categorize networks into two different categories based on their geographical region: __LAN__ and __WAN__.  A LAN (or local area network) is typically found within a single building, i.e. your home, a school, etc.  Whereas a WAN (or wide area network) is considered a network connection that connects LANs to each other, or to connect via a larger geographical distance, i.e across the world, or school to school.

####Topologies
What is a network topology? It is the arrangement of the elements of a network.
